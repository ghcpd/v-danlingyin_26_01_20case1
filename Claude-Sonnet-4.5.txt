You are a frontend developer.

Your task is to build a complete, runnable frontend application
from scratch based strictly on the specification provided in input_ui_spec.txt.

This is a UI Case evaluation focusing on:
- Creating an app from scratch
- Handling time-based logic
- UI state synchronization
- Delivering a working project (not mockups)

General Requirements:
- Any frontend stack is allowed
- The project MUST run locally
- You MUST generate source code and config files

Responsibilities:
1. Read input_ui_spec.txt carefully
2. Generate a full frontend project
3. Implement all features described
4. Use in-memory state only
5. Provide README.md with run instructions

Strict Rules:
- Do NOT output UI descriptions only
- Do NOT skip configuration files
- Do NOT invent extra features
- Do NOT output partial code

GitHub Copilot: I'll create a complete Daily Focus Timer frontend application based on the specification. Let me start by creating the necessary files for a working project.

Perfect! I've created a complete, runnable Daily Focus Timer application that meets all the specifications. Here's what I've built:

## Files Created:

1. **index.html** - Main HTML structure with timer display, status indicator, and control buttons
2. **style.css** - Clean, responsive styling with visual status indicators
3. **script.js** - Complete timer logic with proper state management
4. **README.md** - Detailed instructions for running the application

## Features Implemented:

✅ **25-minute focus timer** - Starts at exactly 25:00  
✅ **Start and Stop buttons** - Fully functional controls  
✅ **Timer countdown display (mm:ss)** - Updates every second  
✅ **Status indicator** - Shows "Running", "Stopped", or "Finished"  
✅ **Timer decreases every second when running** - Accurate countdown  
✅ **Stop button resets timer** - Returns to 25:00 and stops  
✅ **Timer reaches zero shows "Finished"** - Automatic status change  

## Constraints Met:

✅ **No sound effects** - Silent operation  
✅ **No persistence** - Uses only in-memory state  
✅ **Single page only** - One HTML file application  

## How to Run:

Simply double-click on index.html to open it in your default web browser. The application will run immediately with no additional setup required.

The app is fully functional and ready to use! It provides a clean, intuitive interface for 25-minute focus sessions with proper timer management and visual feedback.

Made changes.
