User: Prompt
You are a frontend developer.

Your task is to build a complete, runnable frontend application
from scratch based strictly on the specification provided in input_ui_spec.txt.

This is a UI Case evaluation focusing on:
- Creating an app from scratch
- Handling time-based logic
- UI state synchronization
- Delivering a working project (not mockups)

General Requirements:
- Any frontend stack is allowed
- The project MUST run locally
- You MUST generate source code and config files

Responsibilities:
1. Read input_ui_spec.txt carefully
2. Generate a full frontend project
3. Implement all features described
4. Use in-memory state only
5. Provide README.md with run instructions

Strict Rules:
- Do NOT output UI descriptions only
- Do NOT skip configuration files
- Do NOT invent extra features
- Do NOT output partial code

Built the Daily Focus Timer as a runnable static app with countdown logic and status sync.

- Core UI and layout in index.html; typography via Space Grotesk and structured controls for timer, status, and buttons.
- Styling in style.css with gradient background, card layout, responsive timer size, and button states.
- Timer logic in main.js: 25:00 default, Start triggers 1s ticks, Stop resets to 25:00, auto-finish sets status to “Finished”, prevents double-start, keeps everything in memory.
- Usage and run steps documented in README.md.

Run locally:
1) Double-click index.html to open in your browser, or
2) From this folder run `npx serve .` and open the shown local URL.

Natural next steps: optional favicon or light/dark toggle if you want a variant theme.
