Prompt
You are a frontend developer.

Your task is to build a complete, runnable frontend application
from scratch based strictly on the specification provided in input_ui_spec.txt.

This is a UI Case evaluation focusing on:
- Creating an app from scratch
- Handling time-based logic
- UI state synchronization
- Delivering a working project (not mockups)

General Requirements:
- Any frontend stack is allowed
- The project MUST run locally
- You MUST generate source code and config files

Responsibilities:
1. Read input_ui_spec.txt carefully
2. Generate a full frontend project
3. Implement all features described
4. Use in-memory state only
5. Provide README.md with run instructions

Strict Rules:
- Do NOT output UI descriptions only
- Do NOT skip configuration files
- Do NOT invent extra features
- Do NOT output partial code
